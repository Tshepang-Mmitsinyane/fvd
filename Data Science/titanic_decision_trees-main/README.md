# titanic_decision_trees
Create a Bagged, Random Forest, and Boosted tree for the Titanic dataset.
From the Random Forest model, we will determine which of the features is the one
that contributes the most to predicting whether a passenger survives or
not.
We will pick one of these methods, and tune the parameters n_estimators and
max_depth.
Report the accuracy of all models and report which model performed the
best, including the values for n_estimators and max_depth that the best
model had.
